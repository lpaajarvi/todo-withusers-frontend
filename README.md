If you don't already have node packet manager and git installed, please install them first.   
Node packet manager can be installed from https://nodejs.org/en/    
Open your preferred terminal (for example cmd in Windows) go to directory where you want this installed, for example c:/test/ in terminal type: 
<p />

### `git clone https://github.com/lpaajarvi/todo-withusers-backend`
<br />

### `cd todo-withusers-backend`
### `npm install`




rename toBeRenamed.txt to a file called \".env\" without a body. For example in windows cmd: 


### `copy toBeRenamed.txt .env`


<p>
 
go back to c:/test/ or equivalent 
</p>

<br/>

### `git clone https://github.com/lpaajarvi/todo-withusers-frontend`
<br />

### `cd todo-withusers-frontend npm install`
<br />

You should open 2 different terminals. One keeping the backend localhost server up, and the other keeping the frontend localhost up. run 

### `npm start`

 in each terminals in the folders that were just created, for example  

### `cd c:\test\todo-withusers-backend`
<br/>
### `npm start`

And then in another terminal  


### `cd c:\test\todo-withusers-frontend`
### `npm start`

Browser should open now and go to the locally hosted web app. If it doesn't, you can enter http://localhost:3000/ in your browser  While the server and website are running locally, the database is in the mongoDb cloud.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
